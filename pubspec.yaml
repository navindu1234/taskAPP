  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - assets/new.png
   - assets/image1.png
   - assets/image2.png
   - assets/image3.png
   - assets/image4.png
   - assets/image5.png
   - assets/sdimage1.png
   - assets/sdimage2.png
   - assets/sdimage3.png
   
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For example:
  fonts:
    - family: RobotoSlab
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/RobotoSlab-VariableFont_wght.ttf

    - family: Lobster
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Lobster-Regular.ttf

    - family: ILoveChristmas
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/I Love Christmas.otf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
